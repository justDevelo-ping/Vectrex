# Vectrex Controller v1.0
 This is the v0.1 of my controller including le PCB.
 
 - Possible Issues :
	- The joystick might be too big and prevent closing the remote inside he vectrex like the original intended
	
The controller is builded by staying fidele to the BOM of the original vectrex controller with part still in production. With the original schematic, the controller joystick is planned to work with 2.4v wich make it hit all the boxes on the test cartridge. a higher voltage Schemetic will be made later.
